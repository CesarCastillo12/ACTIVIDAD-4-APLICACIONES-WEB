    <h1 id="HTML_2.0">HTML 2.0</h1>
    <P>In 1995 the HTM L 2.0 standard is published. Despite its name, HTM L 2.0 is the first official HTM L standard, ie HTM L 1.0 does not exist as a standard. HTM L 2.0 does not support tables. The structure of the document was simplified to the maximum to speed up its edition, where the clean declaration of the body, html and head elements is optional.
        The first serious standard to see the light of day was HTML 2.0. This standard was intended to satisfy all existing browsers and at first it succeeded. In fact, we can consider that all existing browsers currently support this standard, therefore any page written using HTML 2.0 code can be viewed in any of them. This standard included:
        Normal text and a few physical and logical styles, but neither size nor color could be changed. There were also some paragraph tags like P or BR but without any attributes.
        Six levels of headings.
        Basic forms.
        Links (also called links).
        Images.
        And very little else. It soon became clear that this standard was insufficient, and very soon the main companies that had created browsers, such as Netscape Navigator and later Internet Explorer. They started inventing new HTML tags which, of course, would only be valid if their browser was used. These new tags were called extensions and among the most important are tables, frames, background images, etc. The disorder arose again.
        </P>
    <h1 id="HTML_3.2">HTML 3.2</h1>
        <p>
            The W3C was quick to publish a new standard, HTML 3.0, which had some of the most successful extensions. However, this standard was vastly different from HTML 2.0. It introduced many new labels, and some of dubious usefulness. For this reason, the Web Consortium itself advised against using it. Shortly after, a revision of this standard appeared, HTML 3.2, which is currently in force. Included in this standard are:
New elements to insert in the header like SCRIPT to include JavaScript or VBScript code and others like STYLE , META, BASE and LINK
New attributes for the BODY tag to set background color or images and to change the color of text and links.
New attributes for most existing tags,
The ability to change the size and color of the text with the FONT tag.
And finally, and probably the most important, the possibility of using tables.
However, not all the extensions that the browser manufacturers had created were included in the standard. Some of them that were very widespread, such as the frames (explained later) were left out, so it was not possible to satisfy everyone. In addition, Microsoft had already fully entered the Internet world with its Internet Explorer browser, which led to an explosion of extensions.

        </p>
    <h1 id="HTML_4.0">HTML 4.0</h1>
    <p>
        Given the great increase in incompatibilities between different browsers, the W3C made a great effort to bring together the main companies and create a new standard that they all agreed to comply with: HTML 4.0. This standard includes many novelties, some of which are widely used, such as frames.
HTML 4.0 is tremendously comprehensive and there are few excuses to create web pages that use extensions. It seems that browser makers have begun to put more emphasis on supporting standards, which allows them to create HTML web pages that look good around the world. Particularly noteworthy is the effort of the Mozilla project, which has taken the reins of the development of the Netscape Navigator browser as free software. In this project they have shown a strong commitment to supporting standards and abandoning proprietary extensions.
Although it is true that using only HTML 4.0 tags we can create pages that can be seen in any browser, other technologies have appeared such as CSS, JavaScript, Java Applets, Flash, etc. whose support varies greatly from one browser to another. These technologies will not be dealt with in this course, but we do want to warn of the importance of using them in such a way that the visitor is not forced to have a specific browser.

    </p>
    <h1 id="HTML_5.0">HTML 5.0</h1>
    <p>
        HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML standard that is used to create the web pages you are visiting, and it incorporates some interesting new features. One of the notable ones is to cover the playback of multimedia content, so that you no longer have to go to third-party resources such as the obsolete Flash Player.
It incorporates new semantic labels that help us define the structure. For example footer, for the footer.
New controls for forms previously only possible with JavaScript or CSS.
Supports audio and video natively.
The use of double quotes in attributes is no longer necessary, something like:
div id=containerThis is a div div.
There isn't such a strict syntax and empty tags don't need to be closed, so
so br would be valid.
Simplified doctype tag.
We can draw with tags like canvas.
Unnecessary tags and attributes such as frames have been removed.
Now the html, head and body tags are not required.
The thead, tbody, and tfoot table tags are also not required.
